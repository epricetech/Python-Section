This folder contains various examples I have done in the Data Analytics world.  They are broken down into 3 sections.  One section is to get and clean the data.  One section is doing
various functions on that data.  The final section is about presenting the analyzed data.
I am not the best at programming.  When trying to write code I use these examples as a base knowledge to help me complete my code.
