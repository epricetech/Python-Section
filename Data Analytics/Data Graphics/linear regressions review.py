# A new dataset named website has been loaded for you in the workspace containing simulated data for a sample of visitors to a
#  website, including the amount of time in seconds they spent on the website (time_seconds), their age (age), 
#  and information about whether they accessed the website using Chrome or Safari (browser).

# Try to work through the following steps (solution code is provided in solution.py). Note that after 
# showing each plot with plt.show(), weâ€™ve included the command plt.clf() in the starting code to ensure 
# that plots are not layered on top of each other.

# Create a plot of time_seconds (vertical axis) versus age (horizontal axis). Is there a linear 
# relationship between these variables?
# Fit a linear model to predict time_seconds using the age variable
# Use the coefficients from the linear model to plot the regression line on top of your original plot.
# Calculate the fitted values and residuals
# Check the normality assumption by plotting a histogram of the residuals. Are they approximately normally distributed?
# Check the homoscedasticity assumption by plotting a the residuals against the fitted values. Is this assumption satisfied?
# Use your model to predict the amount of time that a 40 year old person will spend on the website.
# Fit another model that predicts time_seconds based on browser.
# Print out the coefficients. What is the difference in average time spent on each browser?
